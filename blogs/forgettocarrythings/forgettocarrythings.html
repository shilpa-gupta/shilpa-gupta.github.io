            <h1>Forget to carry things every time you go out?</h1>
            <h4>Feb 3, 2017</h4>
            <p>
                Do you fall in the category of people who forget to carry one thing or other every time they go out from the house?<br>
            </p>
            <img src="media/image1.webp">
            <p>
                We got your back !!<br>
            </p>
            <img src="media/image2.webp">
            <p>
                Here is a very simple idea of an application, which will save you from such crisis.<br>
                The idea is to remind you to carry important stuff when ever you are going out of your house.<br>
                we can send a notification to your phone to check out the list of important stuff which you should be carrying along with you.<br>
                But how do we know the right time to send such reminder/notification?<br>
                Your home wi-fi will tell us !!<br>
                at the time of first installation of the application we will ask you to choose your home wi-fi among all the wi-fi connections available.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="media/image3.webp">
            <p>
                Once you choose one among the available connections, we know which one is your home wi-fi connection. now whats next?<br>
                well we need to know what all items you generally carry. so that we can remind you to carry those important items.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="media/image4.webp">
            <p>
                Now that we have your items and home wifi information, you are all set. just click the "done" button.<br>
                Now the application will keep looking for your home wi-fi singnal.<br>
                Let's say you are going out we will starting to loose the wi-fi signal we will send a push notification to your phone.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="media/image5.webp">
            <p>
                The phone will vibrate and notify the user via vibration to check the phone.<br>
                we will show a notification which will be visible at the top of the screen, when user click on it he/she will see the list of items to make sure the user is carrying them.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="media/image6.webp">
            <p>
                Now the user can check the list and make sure he is carrying all the items of need, once done user can click on i am good and close the app.<br>
                This is a very simple design idea to solve the problem of forgetting things.<br>
                This model can be tested with any number of people who have some home wi-fi connection and want not to forget things to carry.<br>
                we can have a simple feedback mechanism embedded in the app to ask user if he/she is satisfy with the application. or we can physically ask for user's feedback to evaluate success or failure of this model.<br>
